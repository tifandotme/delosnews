## Overview

There is no authentication. Data unique to your usage such as your balance or purchased articles are stored in the browser's local storage. To reset your balance or purchased articles, you can delete the local site data.

### Routes

Routes available in the application are as follows:

```plaintext
/              (Home page with a list of articles)
/[articleId]   (Article detail page)
/purchased     (Purchased articles page)
/lucky         (Lucky Coin page)
```

### Environment Variables

The application uses the following environment variables:

- `API_KEY`: Provide your own New York Times API key if you want to run this application locally. Make sure you have enabled "Most Popular" and "Article Search" in your account API settings.
- `FETCH_DELAY` (optional): Simulate a fetch delay in "/" route. This is useful for testing the loading state during infinite scrolling. Default is 0.

### Lucky Coin Minigame

The Lucky Coin minigame is a simple game where you can draw or "flip a coin" to earn rewards. The cost of entering a round is 3 tickets. For each round, you can draw 3 times.

The prizes are as follows:

- 50000 coins (max 1 per round)
- 20000 coins
- 1 ticket
- A try again

You can earn 3 tickets for each purchase of an article with a minimum price of 50000.
